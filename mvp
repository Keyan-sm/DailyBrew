MVP: 
Input: Your favorite newsletters
Pulled straight from email, so we dont need to worry abt logging into mult services to gather inputs 
Could easily pull based on subject line of each newsletter or email address 
Output: A daily podcast that recaps what's in your inbox today.
Similar style to morning brew daily; conversational 
Tentatively, will use the eleven lab podcast API Create Podcast | ElevenLabs Documentation 
We will engineer a system prompt to curate the style and tone of the podcast; later


Tentative user pipeline:
1. Sign in with google
2. Select 3-4 daily newsletters 
3. Each morning at x time, automatically parse thru each newsletter 
4. Feed into system promt, create podcast 
5. Possibly just publish podcasts to spotify 
For mvp, avoids front end for now
